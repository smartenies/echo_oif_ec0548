# echo_oif_ec0548
Analytic code for my ECHO OIF Cycle 4 Project (EC0548)

EC0548 is an OIF-funded ECHO project investigating the effects of neighborhood-level environmental exposures on BMI in early childhood. The goals of EC0548 are to:

- Ascertain associations between individual neighborhood-level exposures and BMI z-scores in early childhoob
- Explore the effects of the mixture of neighborhood-level exposures on BMI z-scores using machine learning methods
- Examine whether using study-specific models of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) improves the models used to ascertain these associations relative to GIS-based measures of TRAP exposure.

This study brings together data from two ECHO cohorts: Healthy Start (based in the Denver metropolitan area) and MADRES (based in Los Angeles).
